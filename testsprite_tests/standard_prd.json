  },
  "product_overview": "Hollow Princess is an immersive narrative web experience blending medical aesthetics with high-fashion storytelling through a minimalist, cinematic single-page site featuring a central 3D Spline object and wall-style navigation.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Communicate a sterile, precise, emotionally restrained luxury aesthetic.",
    "Deliver a smooth, cinematic experience optimized for desktop and mobile.",
    "Showcase a central 3D Spline model with synchronized camera and scroll-driven motion.",
    "Implement intuitive, accessible wall navigation and active section tracking.",
    "Maintain high performance and subtle motion with strict adherence to animation guidelines."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Next.js App Router based single-page application with four curated content sections.",
    "Global styling via Tailwind CSS v4 implementing a surgical minimalism visual style.",
    "Fixed frosted glass header with brand typography and subtle interaction states.",
    "Loading screen that fades after 3D assets and first section are ready.",
    "Central 3D Spline scene with camera transitions managed smoothly on user scroll and section changes.",
    "Wall navigation component highlighting the active section and supporting keyboard accessibility.",
    "Subtle vignette overlay for focus tuning, toggleable for performance testing.",
    "Scroll indicator prompting user engagement and fading after initial scroll.",
    "Modular content sections with cinematic scroll-driven animations and responsive mobile variants.",
    "Smooth scrolling using Lenis with centralized scroll handling to avoid conflicts.",
    "Hooks for active section tracking, device type detection, and reduced motion preferences.",
    "Strict layout and alignment for Section 2 dates and locations to avoid overlapping the 3D scene."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User lands on the site and sees the loading screen while assets including the 3D Spline scene load.",
    "Post loading, the vignette overlay appears focusing the viewport center with the fixed frosted header visible.",
    "User scrolls or navigates via the fixed wall navigation to move between four main sections, each animating in with subtle fades and transforms.",
    "As the user scrolls, the 3D Spline camera transitions smoothly, synchronized to the current section.",
    "Wall navigation updates highlight the active section and supports keyboard navigation and screen readers.",
    "Scroll indicator initially pulses near the viewport fold and fades after user engagement.",
    "On mobile devices, simplified layouts and reduced motion options ensure a consistent experience.",
    "Accessibility features such as keyboard focus, sufficient contrast, and respect for reduced motion preferences are maintained throughout."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Header is fixed with correct frosted glass effect, soft typography, and precise z-index layering.",
    "3D Spline central object renders correctly with smooth camera transitions tied to scroll and active section.",
    "Wall navigation highlights the current section and scrolls smoothly to anchors supporting keyboard focus.",
    "Scroll indicator pulses initially and fades after first scroll interaction as per animation timing guidelines.",
    "Section 2 enforces left alignment of dates and right alignment of locations to prevent overlap with the central 3D model.",
    "Smooth scrolling integrates Lenis properly without double scroll handlers or jank, preserving keyboard navigation functionality.",
    "Animations comply with prescribed durations (UI fades ≤1.2s, scroll transitions ≤2s) and easing functions.",
    "Performance meets targets: First Contentful Paint ≤ 2.5s and Time to Interactive ≤4s on mid-tier devices.",
    "Accessibility checks affirm no major WCAG 2.1 AA blockers, including keyboard navigability, color contrast, and reduced motion adherence.",
    "Fallbacks activate on errors or low-power devices, such as static hero image and disabled advanced motion.",
    "All key components function as expected across target devices and screen sizes with no layout shifts or content overlap."
