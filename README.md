Status: Concept
Type: Cinematic UI Prototype

Hollow Princess is a narrative-driven web experience built around a fictional fashion-tech capsule collection. It explores cinematic scrolling, 3D product storytelling, and emotionally resonant UI design — not a functional store or game.

There is no backend, e-commerce logic, or game engine implemented in this concept.

Overview

Hollow Princess imagines what a modern, experimental brand site could feel like when product, lore, and interaction are woven into one seamless scroll experience. The concept combines responsive 3D scenes, scroll-based camera transitions, glass UI, and minimalist text to create a surreal, immersive interface.

Under the hood, this is a modern Next.js front-end prototype — there is no real shopping system, inventory, or dynamic content.

Live Preview

Demo coming soon
Planned: hosted preview via Vercel

⸻

Features
• Cinematic scroll behavior: Spline-driven 3D transitions tied to precise scroll positions
• Sectioned storytelling: White “chapter breaks” inserted between scene transitions
• Spline + scroll sync: Camera-driven background scenes that evolve with user progression
• Glass UI & capsule aesthetic: Minimalist, clinical UI that reflects the project narrative
• Mobile-aware layout: Split desktop/mobile scene setups for performance and clarity
• Character & lore hints: Tone and visuals hinting at a broader world in development

⸻

Tech Stack
• Next.js 14 – App Router structure
• React 19 – Component-driven UI
• TypeScript – Strongly typed component layout
• Tailwind CSS – Utility-first styling
• Framer Motion – Subtle motion & viewport animations
• Spline 3D – Scroll-controlled camera-driven scenes
• Lenis (optional) – Smooth scroll behavior
• Vercel (planned) – Zero-config hosting

The stack is used purely for front-end storytelling — there is no real product backend or e-commerce engine implemented.

⸻

Status
• UI concept only — built as a visual narrative & prototype
• No checkout, cart, or commerce logic
• Placeholder content used in several sections
• Spline scenes are static and optimized for preview, not production

⸻

Folder Structure (simplified)

app/
 page.tsx — Primary scroll experience
 components/ — Motion wrappers, UI blocks, chapters, etc.
 styles/ — Global styles (if any additional)

public/
 images/ — Visuals, textures, branding assets
 spline/ — 3D scene files or assets (optional)

This structure is subject to iteration but organized to help designers and developers navigate quickly.

⸻

Setup

No backend or external API keys required — this is a pure front-end prototype. 1. Clone the repository 2. Install dependencies using pnpm install or npm install 3. Run the development server using pnpm dev or npm run dev 4. Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to explore the experience locally

⸻

Screenshots

Screenshots and UI captures will be added in a future update:
• Cinematic scroll sections
• White chapter interludes
• 3D hero/product scenes
• UI overlays and text components

Under the Hood

Hollow Princess was created as a personal design and development project to explore:
• Narrative UI — scroll-driven product storytelling
• Motion and camera sync — blending UI and scene transitions
• Interaction clarity — motion and layout used with purpose, not flair
• Creative direction — fusing fashion, tech, and surrealism into a unified interface

It is not an actual store, game, or commercial product.
If you’d like to discuss the design or implementation, or how this approach could evolve into a real project, feel free to reach out.
